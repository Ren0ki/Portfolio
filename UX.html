	<h2> Project 1: What Can a Starship Do?</h2>
	<br>
	<p>For this assignment, team was asked to come with a solution that improves human to human connection with the Purdue <i>Starship</i> system. My team's involves a sticker app called <i> Starship: StickerScapes</i> which is an app that gives users a chance to earn digital stickers when interacting with Starships. The app also implements a social media-based system that allows users to interact with others with personalized avatars. As a result, the school's community will have the opportunity to interact with peers over a shared leisurely activity. </p>

	<h2> Project 2: Embodied Shopping </h2>
	<br><br>
	<p> Here, our team was tasked with finding a solution to encourage in-person shopping. Our design involved the implementation of a mobile app that guides users through the in-person shopping experience. Through survey-based research, we found that users would benefit from a product that bridges the gap between online and in-person shopping. Thus, the technological aspect of this app can give users a sense of familarity in an otherwise unexplored environment. </p>
